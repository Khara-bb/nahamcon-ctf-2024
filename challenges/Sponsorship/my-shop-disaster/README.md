# My Shop Disaster

## Description

<small>Author: Patchstack</small><br><br>I just installed wordpress to sell my stuff with Woocommerce. I found it a bit boring so I installed that other plugin to pimp it, I don't think it could cause a security issue? <br><br> This is a whitebox challenge, no need to bruteforce anything (login, endpoint, etc). <br><br> <b>Challenge may take anywhere between 1-3 minutes to fully start up.</b> <br><br> <b>NOTE, the challenge has a non-standard flag format. You will find a <code>CTF{}</code> wrapper around standard_text.</b> <br><br> <b>Press the <code>Start</code> button on the top-right to begin this challenge.</b> <br> <hr> <br> Special thank you to <b><a href="https://patchstack.com/">Patchstack</a></b> for sponsoring the NahamCon 2024 CTF! This category is dedicated to them as a token of gratitude. <br> <img style="max-width: 22%;" src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/602c7af03d9bab5833f7d129/6645ac49-fad3-4ad9-af77-26242ceb589f/patchstack_logo_light.png?format=1500w" alt="Patchstack Logo">
