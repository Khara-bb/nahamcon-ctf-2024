# 1337 Malware

## Description

<small>Author: @Jstith</small><br><br>We received a plea for help from a rather frustrated looking employee.  He said he accidently ran malware on his computer, but when he tried to  pay the "leet hacker" to get his files back they said the malware was  "broken"... best IT could do was provide us a PCAP. <br><br> <b>Download the file(s) below.</b> <br> <hr> <br> Special thank you to <b><a href="https://flare.io/">Flare</a></b> for sponsoring the NahamCon 2024 CTF!
